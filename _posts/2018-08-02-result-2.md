  <p>For these questions, we would like to know how developers think about the Microsoft acquisition of GitHub. Thus, we asked them about their knowledge about GitHub.</p>
  <p>The results of the survey show that most of the participants have a negative perspective of Microsoft acquisition GitHub. It means developers fail to see the benefit of Microsoft. In addition, participants think the acquisition will be detrimental to any projects that they contribute toward and participants do not agree to the acquisition will trigger even more expansion of Free and open Source contributors in GitHub and this acquisition will bring improvements in the reliability and services of GitHub platform</p>
  <p>In detail, figure 2-1, 55.2% of 241 participants think the acquisition will be detrimental to any projects that they contribute toward. According to figure 2-2, 74.3% of 241 participants do not agree to the acquisition will trigger even more expansion of Free and Open Source contributors in GitHub. Figure 2-3  shows 55.2% of participants do not agree with this acquisition will bring improvements in the reliability and services of GitHub platform.</p>
