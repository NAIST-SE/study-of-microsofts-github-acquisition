Sending survey is one of important process. We pay much attention to select the target and channel. We want to make sure this request does not disturb developers working. However, getting answers is very important too. We would like to get answers from our target, do not just people from somewhere.

There are 4 choices for us.

## 1. Forums

Forum is the most open way. Everyone can see this survey request, but we want to make sure our participants are our target. We solved this problem by choosing specific forums. We chose Linux distributions and BSD forums. In these forums, there are contributors and users.

<p id="chart-des"><i>Post in Manjaro’s forum, <br>taken from https://forum.manjaro.org/t/research-survey-impact-of-microsoft-acquisition-of-github/51308 </i></p>

We posted on the most opened room, off-topic or general room. Specific room may disturb developers because they may use these forum to track user issues.

## 2. Mailing Lists

A mailing list is a list of people who subscribe to a periodic mailing distribution on a particular topic. On the Internet, mailing lists include each person's email address rather than a postal address. Mailing lists have become a popular way for Internet users to keep up with topics they're interested in. Many software producers and other vendors are now using them as a way to keep in touch with customers.

Including Linux distributions and BSD, they also use within organization. Consequently, developers usually use mailing lists for their work. If we send survey by mailing lists, we can make sure developers receive survey participant request. Furthermore, because we send to developers mailing lists, less user will receive this mail. The request of mailing lists should be more personal than forums example for the forums,

> Dear contributors, 

For mailing list, we change it into..

> Dear XXXXX developers,

Both forums and mailing lists have “rules”. You have to read it before post or send something. If the rule do not let us to post, you do not post or send. If you violate, you may be banned. It is hard for you to send further survey on the banning forums.

## 3. Developers' Email
--------
![]({{ "/images/forumsAndMail/email1.png" | absolute_url }})
<p id="chart-des"><i>MX Linux contact form https://mxlinux.org/contact</i></p>

This one is the most specific way to send. In my opinion, if I receive survey participation request email, I may think it is spam and I will throw it to trash. However, this is the last choice and we did not send any request via email since we receive enough responses from both mailing lists and forums.

You can find developers’ email by their GitHub. You get the developers GitHub username and search them on the Internet. Some of distros reveal their team on their website, and some of distros also reveal their email.

## 4. Contact Forms
--------

<p id="chart-des"><i>MX Linux contact form https://mxlinux.org/contact</i></p>

Moreover there are “contact form”. We do not send via contact form because we do not sure our target receive this request or not. Some of them may be reach because developers monitor this form by themselves, but some of form sales monitor this form and may look over this request.
