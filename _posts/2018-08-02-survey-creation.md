## 2.  Goal & Motivation
### Goal
Understanding how do contributors of the Linux distributions and BSD families perceive Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub.
### Assumption 
- Developers are afraid of changes
- Developers have personal preferences
- Developers prefer the features of GitHub
- Developers are more interested in technical aspects

### Target
We target contributors of Linux distributions/kernel and BSD families because they are likely to FLOSS developers, anyone cannot controlled them. Free is important and which may be influenced by the acquisition.

## 3. Survey platform
We choose [Google forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/)  as survey platform because it is all free and easy to contribute. However, we found later that many people don’t like Google form because of privacy concerns.
