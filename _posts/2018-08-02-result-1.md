  <p>We would like to know who are our participants as well as how they think about GitHub. Therefore, we asked them about their roles and main activities and also if they were fans of GitHub and its current functions.</p>
  <p>Results of the survey indicate that most of our participants are casual contributors to the Linux distributions and BSD projects. Also, we find that most participants have positive opinions to GitHub. Participants also feel that GitHub appeals to them as it grants access to over 27 million users in this community and GitHub provides a set of useful functions that every developer will benefit.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In detail, Figure 1-1 shows that 61.8% of 241 participants are casual contributors, which is the majority of the participants. According to Figure 1-2, 62.2% of participants are fans of GitHub. From Figure 1-3, 61% of participants agree with GitHub appeals to them as it grants access to over 27 million users in this community, but 20.3% of participants do not have opinion with this question. As shown in Figure 1-4, 58.1% of participants agree with GitHub has a set of useful functions (e.g., GitHub Page, Project Management) that every developer will benefit. We see from Figure 1-5 that most participants satisfied with the current functions of GitHub. Figure 1-6 shows 44% of participants do not think the GitHub platform is superior compared to similar platforms.</p>
