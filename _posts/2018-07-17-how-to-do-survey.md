Our survey available on this link https://goo.gl/forms/xe8Y1MrvUO83rfKK2

## 1. reading news and article about Microsoft aquisition. 
- [Microsoft Buys GitHub: The Linux Foundationâ€™s Reaction](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/microsoft-buys-github-the-linux-foundations-reaction/)
- [Why GitHub Can't Host the Linux Kernel Community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14972872)

- [GitHub rivals gain from Microsoft acquisition but it's no mass exodus, yet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-rivals-gain-from-microsoft-acquisition-but-its-no-mass-exodus-yet/)

## 2. defining goal and assumption of this survey.
### Goal
How do contributors of the Linux distributions perceive Microsoft acquirement GitHub?
### Assumption 
- Developers are afraid of change
- Developers have personal preferences
- Developers prefer the features of GitHub
- Developers are more interested in technical aspects
### Target
We target contributors of Linux distributions/kernel and BSD families because you are serious developers.

## 3. Design question
Our question have to answer the assumptions and not straightforward. However, it is just draft, we create question straightforward and will revise them later.
## How to answer
- We try to make you easy to answer and not scroll anything for answer the questions.
### Multiple choice
![]({{ "/images/choice/multiple.png" | absolute_url }})
I want participants to answer only one choice, so I use basic multiple choice. This is the easiest way to answer.
### Checkbox
![]({{ "/images/choice/checkbox.png" | absolute_url }})

  Some of participants hestitate to answer these questions, so participants can select more than one answer and can add new choice.
### Linear scale
![]({{ "/images/choice/linear_scale.png" | absolute_url }})

  Most of question use linear scale. Linear scale is easy to answer and interprete. We put "No opinion" at number 0 for hestitate participants.

### Long answer
![]({{ "/images/choice/long_answer.png" | absolute_url }})
  Participant can feel free to put all of their opinion in this box.

## 4. Implement question on survey platform
  We choose Google form as survey platform because it is all free and easy to contribute. However, there are many people don't apply this survey because they do not trust Google privacy. As a result, I change to use eSurvey Creator. This tool is free for student.
  Actually, there are many great tools, but they have some limitations which affect with our work such as 

  - I can create 10 questions per survey.
  - I can resurve 100 response per month.

  There are not enough for this survey.
