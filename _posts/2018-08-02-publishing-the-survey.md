Sending survey is one of important process. We pay much attention to select the target and channel. We want to make sure this request does not disturb developers working. However, getting answers is very important too. We would like to get answers from our target, do not just people from somewhere.

Following the rules of each project, we sent surveys via forums or mailing lists.

## 1. Forums

Forum is the most open way. Everyone can see this survey request, but we want to make sure our participants are our target. We solved this problem by choosing specific forums. We chose Linux distributions and BSD forums. In these forums, there are contributors and users.

We posted on the most opened room, off-topic or general room. Specific room may disturb developers because they may use these forum to track user issues.

## 2. Mailing Lists

A mailing list is another chanel. By choosing developer mailing lists, we can eliminate users from our survey.
