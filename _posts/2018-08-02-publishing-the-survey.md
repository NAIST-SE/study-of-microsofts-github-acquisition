Sending survey is one of important process. We pay much attention to select the target and channel. We want to make sure this request does not disturb developers working. However, getting answers is very important too. We would like to get answers from our target, do not just people from somewhere.

Forum is the most open way. Everyone can see this survey request, but we want to make sure our participants are our target. We solved this problem by choosing specific forums. We chose Linux distributions and BSD forums. In these forums, there are contributors and users.

We posted on the most opened room, off-topic or general room. Specific room may disturb developers because they may use these forum to track user issues.

## 2. Mailing Lists

Including Linux distributions and BSD, they also use within organization. Consequently, developers usually use mailing lists for their work. If we send survey by mailing lists, we can make sure developers receive survey participant request. Furthermore, because we send to developers mailing lists, less user will receive this mail. The request of mailing lists should be more personal than forums example for the forums,

> Dear contributors, 

For mailing list, we change it into..

> Dear XXXXX developers,

Both forums and mailing lists have “rules”. We have to read it before post or send something. If the rule do not let us to post, we do not post or send. If you violate, we may be banned. It is hard for you to send further survey on the banning forums.
