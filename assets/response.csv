As a compromise, our Gerrit instance allow people to log in with their Github account, as some devs says that having to create a dedicated account for us would stop people from contributing (I'm not sure I agree, if someone is not motivated enough to create an account, why would I think they could become contributors sending many patches?).

In the past we were hosted on 3rd party websites (sourceforge and berlios) and have learnt that nothing lasts forever and it is not wise to put our codebase and workflow in the hands of a 3rd party.

FOSS <> proprietary for me is simply an opposite approach.

All of them are proprietary and depend on a single company.

For GitHub (&co) the situation is the same: in the past (an few project keep this paradigma) we work on ml, we host projects on a variety of hosts, many are from project members itself (think at Debian's mirros by ISPs that use Debian). Now people tend to concentrate on single proprietary platform like GitHub, GitLab etc. It doesn't matter if the holder is Microsoft or Dr. Foo Bar: they are company, their goal is making money. We can have a common interest but it can't least forever. On open platforms when the interest diverge the switch is easy, for instance if you change your mail service it's a matter of IMAP transfert. If you switch from a proprietary platform to another MANY thing may change. It may be hard.

It is a mandatory question but there are other answers besides ""everything uses Github"", ""nothing has ever used Github"", and ""one project I contribute to has left Github"".

You never define what you mean by ""Linux distributions"". None of the major Linux distributions use Github directly for everything, but there are many projects packaged by Linux distributions that do use Github.

It feels like you haven't given enough thought about why people have their opinion of the Microsoft acquisition. Some people think Microsoft is the Evil Empire, others think that Microsoft is just another tech company and generally isn't evil these days. That is a big split in the open source community.

There is a huge irony with some open source people being upset at the Github thing when Github isn't even open source at all.",,,,
